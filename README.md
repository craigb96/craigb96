- 👋 Hi, I’m Craig Brewton.  I am a professional developer that works with C#/.NET on desktop and web applications for my employer.  The code you will find in this repository is some variation of that primary stack.  I am accustomed to using MVC architecture, though I am no expert in such.  For web development, I am familiar with Angular/Typescript, HTML, and SCSS.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning anything I can when it comes to software development.  I want to be the best developer that I can be.
- 🌱 Currently, I’m currently learning mobile development with C#/Xamarin.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project on which you think I can add value.  Just ask me.
- 📫 I can be reached at craigb1234@gmail.com.
